This is an auto-updating [Altstore source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Balackburn/Winston/main/apps.json) for **Winston for Reddit**. It checks daily for new releases and updates the source with the latest version, ensuring you always have access to the most recent updates.

I've called this repo only "Winston", for a better presentation on my Github Page site (not done yet).

# Why?

I really love Winston and hope it will help some people to keep using it instead of the official app, also Testflight is full.
